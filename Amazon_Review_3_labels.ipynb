       "1    hi so after using this mic for about a month i am writing this review so i will be giving the most genuine review about this mic what a beginner needs a budget mic that is pocket friendly yet gives the best output built quality mic piece is very compact and and handy to use size is small so very convenient to carry anywhere you want cable wire is extraordinarily long meters however that is a great plus point long wire makes recording more easier it has a velcro for cable management so not a difficult task to keep the lengthy wire under control weighs around gms there are no batteries included there s a switch on off button while recording you need to switch to camera mode don t really know why its written camera sound quality my recordings have improved considerably with this mic and i am loving it just one complain i have it captures lot of air flow meaning i can hear lot of air of my mouth in the final output even if i record anything while holding the mic from a considerable distance i can hear my breathing sounds sound quality is loud enough and crisp it does capture my room s ceiling fan sound so i can hear that whoosh sound in the background when i am plugged into my earphones i record with the ac on and keep the fan switched off also it comes with a handy pouch to keep your mic safely yaayyy so finally best for production for a beginner like me because at this price it gives ample quality output \n",
       "2    product quality was good not bad the build was also good but one thing i want to say that please mention that it require a connector to connect with dslr most of entry level dslr or should provide a connector for dslr that is very useful and helpful for the customers because the connecter not available in any local market and when it buy through online shops some of it does not support the mic facility so we cannot get a proper product which support the mic and dslr i bought the product about i think weeks ago but still the product is in new condition that is it is in the box only because i did not get any connector suitable to connect with dslr and mic so kindly provide your own genuine connector for connecting with dslr it is a good and helpful for customers who is buying this product most of all customers are buying it for dslr so kindly do it for your valuable customers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "1  hi so after using this mic for about a month i am writing this review so i will be giving the most genuine review about this mic what a beginner needs a budget mic that is pocket friendly yet gives the best output built quality mic piece is very compact and and handy to use size is small so very convenient to carry anywhere you want cable wire is extraordinarily long meters however that is a great plus point long wire makes recording more easier it has a velcro for cable management so not a difficult task to keep the lengthy wire under control weighs around gms there are no batteries included there s a switch on off button while recording you need to switch to camera mode don t really know why its written camera sound quality my recordings have improved considerably with this mic and i am loving it just one complain i have it captures lot of air flow meaning i can hear lot of air of my mouth in the final output even if i record anything while holding the mic from a considerable distance i can hear my breathing sounds sound quality is loud enough and crisp it does capture my room s ceiling fan sound so i can hear that whoosh sound in the background when i am plugged into my earphones i record with the ac on and keep the fan switched off also it comes with a handy pouch to keep your mic safely yaayyy so finally best for production for a beginner like me because at this price it gives ample quality output    \n",

       "1  hi so after using this mic for about a month i am writing this review so i will be giving the most genuine review about this mic what a beginner needs a budget mic that is pocket friendly yet gives the best output built quality mic piece is very compact and and handy to use size is small so very convenient to carry anywhere you want cable wire is extraordinarily long meters however that is a great plus point long wire makes recording more easier it has a velcro for cable management so not a difficult task to keep the lengthy wire under control weighs around gms there are no batteries included there s a switch on off button while recording you need to switch to camera mode don t really know why its written camera sound quality my recordings have improved considerably with this mic and i am loving it just one complain i have it captures lot of air flow meaning i can hear lot of air of my mouth in the final output even if i record anything while holding the mic from a considerable distance i can hear my breathing sounds sound quality is loud enough and crisp it does capture my room s ceiling fan sound so i can hear that whoosh sound in the background when i am plugged into my earphones i record with the ac on and keep the fan switched off also it comes with a handy pouch to keep your mic safely yaayyy so finally best for production for a beginner like me because at this price it gives ample quality output                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "2  product quality was good not bad the build was also good but one thing i want to say that please mention that it require a connector to connect with dslr most of entry level dslr or should provide a connector for dslr that is very useful and helpful for the customers because the connecter not available in any local market and when it buy through online shops some of it does not support the mic facility so we cannot get a proper product which support the mic and dslr i bought the product about i think weeks ago but still the product is in new condition that is it is in the box only because i did not get any connector suitable to connect with dslr and mic so kindly provide your own genuine connector for connecting with dslr it is a good and helpful for customers who is buying this product most of all customers are buying it for dslr so kindly do it for your valuable customers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "3  when recording on phone or laptop the quality was the same as you get from a regular headphone i watched review about this product on y tube even on the technical guruji channel its a marketing strategy i guess these are useless microphones with no noise cancellation i dont know about if you r using it on dslr but on fon or pc it will give no special output same fan noise and all returned                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "4  i will give my honest review on boya m read this full and i may help you clear your dilemma if you need in depth review i have a review video on youtube go to youtube com mobiletechpoint or search for mobile tech point boya m and you will find the review video audio for the entire video has been recorded with boya m i bought boya m for rupees so this is a great pro mic for the price first thing we notice is that the cable is meters long which is super lengthy so you have to be good in cable management it is nice to see that battery unit is made of metal if you use the mic with smartphones you do not need a battery because the mic draws the power from the phone but in case of dslr you need to switch to camera mode good part of this mic is that it can connect with smartphones tablets pc dslr s and external audio recorders like zoom h n that is pretty awesome right for the price we pay this mic gives you excellent quality audio having a meter cable can be an advantage or disadvantage it depends on how you look at it if you are using the mic with external recorder you do not need a m cable but if you are using the mic with a dslr camera and if you want to move around it gives you all the freedom the other only concern that you need to be aware of is since there is no battery indicator you might want to carry an extra battery if you are going to record something important which you do not want to miss at all put in a new battery and you will be fine if you are into audio recording then boya m lavalier mic is a must have even if you have an external audio recorder or a condenser mic get this mic as well i am sure this will come in handy at some point of time if you have any doubts post a comment on my youtube video i will answer your query thanks buy this    \n",
